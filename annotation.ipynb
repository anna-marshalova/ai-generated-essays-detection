With less cars clogging the streets, citizens can walk, bike, and play more freely, reducing stress and creating a positive community atmosphere. \n",

For example, Bogota, Colombia has seen improvements in air quality after implementing a \"Day Without Cars.\" And Paris had to issue driving bans due to dangerous smog levels caused in part by diesel emissions. Limiting cars can literally save lives and allow the public to breathe easier.  \n",

      "3) Promotion of alternative sustainable transport. With cars off the streets, citizens are incentivized to use public transport, walk, or bike for their daily commutes. These modes of transport have zero emissions, and managing life without owning a car leads to adopting more sustainable behaviors long-term. The environmental benefits include reducing CO2 emissions and greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Researchers show that Americans are driving less, and young people especially are disinterested in cars, signaling a cultural shift away from car culture. \n",

The banning of cars has been a great success with now people using bikes or walking as their means of transportation. Even though car ownership is <AI>permitted,the </AI>problem is that there are only two places to park which cost about 40,000 dollars along with your home. The result of that actions is that 70 percent of people do not own a car and 57 percent sold the car to live in the city. One person states \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way\" says Heidrun Walter. The citizens of this city have been feeling better about having no car you dont have the stress to have to drive you have the calm relaxing time by walking or biking. did you know that \"passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in car intensive areas in the United States<AI>.\"T</AI>he greenhouse gas has been a problem ever since the development of motor power cars.

The smog has always been a problem for Paris it usually has more smog than in any European country. The article states that \"Paris has 147 micrograms of perticulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,Reuters found.\" The romantic city of Paris cant be as wonderful if it always has a problem with having too much smog I believ that the cars are the ones to blame for this matter that if the city of paris bans its cars that the smog will decrease and become a the romantic city that it is. The article states that \"diesel fuel was blamed since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western Europe.\" That means that it is in fact the motor cars that are the ones causeing the overflow of the smog.

They have the same problem in Brazil where they have one of the worlds worst traffic jams in history. The ones who delevoped the car free day was trying to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Someone states in the article \"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. The stress of having a car in a countries capital can be stressful to some people and that bikeing or walking is a way to help calm someone after a busy day at work. Due to the car free day the city states that \"uneven, pitted side walks have been replaced by broad,smooth sidewalks, rush hour restirictions have dramatically cut traffic.\"The car free day i feel is benefitting everyone from getting rid of traffic jams to clearing up the smog.

Promoting public transit over private vehicles is crucial for meeting emissions reduction targets.\r",

       "<br>\r",
       "<br>More Opportunities for Exercise: Car-free communities encourage more walking and biking. Building bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly sidewalks motivates residents to get outdoors. This promotes healthy lifestyles and addresses public health issues like obesity.\r",

       "<br>Overall, limiting car usage through urban planning and policy initiatives like car-free days has social, environmental, and economic benefits.

When Paris banned half its cars for a day due to dangerous smog levels, congestion dropped 60% with 4,000 fewer cars crowding city streets. Bogota hosts an annual car-free Day Without Cars, reducing stress and pollution while promoting alternative transportation like buses, bikes, and walking.
